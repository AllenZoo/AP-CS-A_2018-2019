## [Course Overview](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-a-course-overview.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-a)
### Administrative Information
- **Instructor**: [Alyssa Fegen](http://www.alyssafegen.com), BSc. Combined Major - Computer Science & Microbiology
- **Contact**: [Email](mailto:alyssafegen@alumni.ubc.ca)
- **Location**: [Elite Educational Institute](http://www.eliteprep.ca/?lang=en) - Richmond Campus (5560-8181 Cambie Rd, Richmond, BC V6X 3X9)
- **Class Time**: Fridays, 17:30 - 19:30 (2 hours a week, ~25 Classes Total i.e. ~50 hours of in-class instruction time)
### Teaching Approach
Classes will vary but will generally have one or a mix of the following structures:
- Lecture and class discussion on new concepts and syntax from the current unit
- Collaborative programming exercises/examples/problems involving the whole class to work together to create a solution
- Individual/collaborated free time to work on the current assignment/lab with supervision

Outside of Class:
- Readings and/or videos may be assigned to students to read/watch prior to the next class to be prepared.
- Students are expected to work on the assignments/labs for the week and submit them by their deadlines. Students may collaborate by discussing answers but must not share code.
- Students may ask me questions about assignments/labs via GitHub. I will allot 30-60 minutes a weekday addressing these questions.
- Email communication should be reserved for only very urgent assignment/lab/exam-related questions, administrative issues (e.g. unable to attend/late to class) or other clarifications. I am unlikely to share my cellphone number with students.

Progress will be tracked using these assignments and labs. To facilitate instructor and student interaction outside of class hours, assignments/labs will be submitted on GitHub so that submissions can be tracked. GitHub issues will be used to delegate assignments/labs, impose deadlines, and encourage discussion amongst students as well as the instructor.

## [Course Description](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-a-course-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-a)

## [Resources]()
- [Java Quick Reference](https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/explore-ap/ap-computer-science-a-2014-java-quick-reference.pdf) - provided in your exam booklet
- [AP Java Subset](https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-computer-science-a-java-subset.pdf) - not included in exam booklet, code in exam is consistent with this subset
- [Javadocs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/overview-summary.html) - detailed useful specifications of the entire Java 7 API

### Textbooks
There is no required text for this course. However, most of the materials in this course will be based on these books:
- [Barron's AP Computer Science A - 8th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Barrons-Computer-Science-Bonus-Online-ebook/dp/B07C2C7HH1) - lots of questions, recommended for your own practice as well
- [McGraw Hill 5 Steps to a 5 - AP Computer Science A (2017)](https://www.amazon.ca/Steps-AP-Computer-Science-2017/dp/0071845909) - great summary of concepts

I also may be incorporating anything I might have learned from the following Computer Science courses I have completed at UBC that I think may be relevant:
- [CPSC 110](https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/main?pname=subjarea&tname=subjareas&req=3&dept=CPSC&course=110): Systematic Program Design
- [CPSC 210](https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/main?pname=subjarea&tname=subjareas&req=3&dept=CPSC&course=210): Software Construction
- [CPSC 221](https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/main?pname=subjarea&tname=subjareas&req=3&dept=CPSC&course=221): Basic Algorithms and Data Structures
- [CPSC 310](https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/main?pname=subjarea&tname=subjareas&req=3&dept=CPSC&course=310): Introduction to Software Engineering

I also have digital copies of the following books that may potentially be helpful with this course and I am willing to lend to students:
- [O'Reilly Head First Object-Oriented Analysis & Design](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596008673.do)
- [O'Reilly Head First Software Development](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596527358.do)
